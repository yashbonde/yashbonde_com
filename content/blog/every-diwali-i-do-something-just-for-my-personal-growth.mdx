I have been working in AI for 8+ years and programming for 10+ years. Life is only so many decades, so when you spend time doing something for a decade it is a good effort to reflect back on it. Celebrate the successes and fix the failures. This is me spending 10 minutes summarising a few lessons I've learnt over 10 years.

## Making money is hard

I have worked only in startup and MSMEs (SMBs for my American friends) and got first hand experience in how making money by creating value for a business is very hard. Especially if the field you are working in is a brand new hype field with unproven technology. Chances of success are exponentially lower than those of failure, so many things have to go right. When I was inexperienced (I'm still young), I would foul mouth certain product and brands. As I've grown, I've come to respect the hustle and people behind more than those products and brands.

## Value of Communicating ie. ढिंढोरा पीटना

One place I've struggled over the years is communicating the work I have done. As I've lived in USA and India I've understood how minor cultural nuances play oversized role in the outcome. I no longer treat clear communication as a task but a way to structure my own thoughts. As I've gone from Medium to having my own (HTML coded!) website on Github, I now move towards Framer. I can now design in a GUI and manage content in a proper CMS. I'm going to use this a lot!

## Project Arth ie. अर्थ

I've always been fascinated by Sanskrit not only as a language but more so because of the literature written in that language. The ancient Indian literature is the backbone of Indian value systems (sometimes misinterpreted as religion Hinduism). As I worked more with large enterprise clients, I've learned how they position and frame new technologies in context of legacy problems. I already knew about the new technologies, now I had to frame the problem. For this I started working on project Arth (pronounced as "earth") which aims to build the largest knowledge corpus for ancient Indian literature.

As I move forth in the new year on this Narak Charturdashi (Ashvina 29, 2081), I bow to Maa Saraswati to bless me with wisdom and knowledge.

ॐ शांति
