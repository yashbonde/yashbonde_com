I am a huge believer in hustling my way, like many I neither have a huge talent that looms over others nor a mentor or teacher to teach me everything I know. But what I do have is dedication and hard work, and this is what separates me from the rest. So someday over a year ago I was listening to the one and only Gary Vaynerchuk and he said something that caught my attention, something on the lines of document, don't create. And then I thought that was stupid, this dude doesn't know what the fuck he is talking. Original work is what creates value and well I still believe that, I changed my opinion about the other thing.

**Document don't create** â€” Gary, the dude I thought didn't know what he was saying.

What I interpreted from it was hard work, just keep working! Soon I looked around me, everyone who was better than me in fact had created more shit than how much good work I had done. The work they did today was what I aimed for myself but that's not possible. The tower of your work will always be tallest if the foundation is solid. And the most solid foundation is the foundation of shit tonne of shit work. And so it got me thinking, how difficult is it to be so called successful, well it's pretty damn hard!

And everyone wants that, so the other way to look at it is how easy is it to fail. Well the truth is a single factor which is in your control (the amount of effort you put in), can change everything. So I wrote down simple mathematics for it:

```
P(talent) probability of talent --> not in your control
N amount of work you do --> in your control
P(success) probability of success --> what we need to determine

If there are two people A and B.
Where A is exceptionally talented and the probability of great work P_a(talent) = 0.5 i.e. 50 % of his work is considered great. But he is your perfectionist guy, the one you aspire to be and sings, say N_a = 20 songs a year.
Where B is not very talented, say above average and the probability of great work P_a(talent) = 0.3 i.e. 30% of his work is considered great. But he works like hell and sings, say N_b = 60 songs a year.

The amount great songs A makes is G_a = P_a(t)xN_a = 0.5x20 = 10
The amount great songs B makes is G_b = P_b(t)xN_b = 0.3x60 = 18
```

Now it's my math geek that came out here, but that proves it. If you work your ass off, the amount of great work you can do is very large. It's mathematically impossible for you to fail. Now you will say that there are so many factors you did not consider that are beyond our control, and that is fair. Life is extremely unpredictable, and the above math is just something I did on a tissue paper. But with only one factor in your control, the effort you put in, you can turn the tables against life.

**It's mathematically impossible for you to fail**

Now this piece mostly came out part rant and part boredom, do hit that clap if you like it. Next time we tackle how to build an AI that does trading on stock market, or maybe something else, who knows.
