Think of Iron Man, 2001: A Space Oddesey or Matrix, all these three movies have something very similar yet drastically different. Each has a unique AI character, that works differently than the other. Jarvis is capable of doing absolutely everything, from designing next generation hardware components to flying multiple robots in synchronised manner. HAL works in a more fixed framework trying to achieve the goal given to it, and in Matrix it has suppressed the humans.

One AI is against the humans, one AI is trying to achieve the goal given to it by humans, and in another it has augmented the humans. Of the three possible scenarios which do you think is the most likely one or the most interesting one?

> A future where AI augments it's human user is most exciting and also the most likely one.

I have always been fascinated by movies and books, the way they portray computers as enslavers of humans. The truth is that today we as a society are way more advanced than what are predecessors could even dream of, but our thinking of enslaving people still hasn't gone away. We live in a capitalist society where everyone having more is better for everyone and realising that slavery is not economical gave way to a better future.

And the best way we can improve everyones standards are by providing them with proper education, technology and tools to build things that are better than what already exists. This is what I mean when I say augmentation.
Augmentation of human skill to develop better tools and in turn give humans more time to perform creative tasks is what I consider to be my baseline target. I work in the field of machine learning though by training I am an electronics engineer. But thinking of how computers will augment humans is much more simpler than actually being able to make this, let alone actually programming it.

> Saying "Come on HAL, let's design a drone today. This should carry 10 Kgs and fly at least 100 Kms" is much easier than actually doing it.

Once you look deeper into any field you realise that there is vast amount of information that you don't know, and can possibly not know unless you spend years working and researching into that field. But the good thing is that we live in a society where getting information and people who can properly use that information can be found with ease. And most of the immitdiate problems lie at the centre of shallow depth of knowledge in multiple domains and deep knowledge in one domain. Thus being a person with T-shape knowledge is immensely benefitial.

Coming back to my quest this blog is what I hope will be a first in a series of writings on topics that I like, ranging from philosophy AI to actual python codes to build them. From design to photography, to just random things that I like or travels I make.Next time we tackle the transformer network or a make new poster for Westworld, who knows, you'll see.

Stay tuned!
